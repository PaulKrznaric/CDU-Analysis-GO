This is a project that performs data analysis of a spreadsheet of patient data outputted by an EMR. 
The software is able to take in a spreadsheet of the (highly) specific format and output the billing amounts into a format that can 
then be appended onto the existing spreadsheet format. 

The software has been written in a manner such that at some point the entire process can be automated, however, it's unlikely that
the time it would take to fully automate the process would account for the time difference between the manual formatting. 

This project replaces an older version of this software written in Java when requirements were different and involved comparison:
